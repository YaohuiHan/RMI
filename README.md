### Level I
For this exercise, you are asked to use Java RMI to implement a basic system that allows a user first to register and then to login. This system could be used for instance in an e-shop application. The system should be developed as a client server application. The user details are stored in a back-end storage (during registration) and then are subsequently used during the login process. The system should give users the option either to register or to login. The back-end storage could be a simple file or data base.

### Level II
了解底层实现，尝试编写MyRMIRegistry，而不是直接使用`start rmiregistry`.
